      <h3>Assembly Sequence of Flywheel Car</h3>
      
      <h5>Assembly Sequence- the sequence in which the components of a product are assembled together to make up the finished product.is a key decision 
made during a product design process that determines an individual product's assembly costs and 
serviceability</h5>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Flywheel Car Toy Assembly sequence can be divided into 4 sections (A,B,C,D). Every sections
includes up to 5 assembling components which interwined between each other. Some components are much more connected with each other and depends on each other than others. Assembling the toy car starts from A and B sections which represents the Core of the car mechanism. It represents inner part of the body mechanism. It consists of the Core Rod, Wheel Weights,
Core Gears, Core Spacer, Core Spring (A1,A2,A3,A4, A5) and B1, B2, B3, B4. This section has to
be assembled first and it was disambeled the last. The section B consists of Wheel Base Shell- B1,
Wheel Gears- 2 identical parts (B2), Shaft- 2 identical pieces (B4). Car has 4 solid wheels -C1
connected to C2 and shafts B4. The A section has to be assembled first, then B section, C section and finally the innner and outer car Shells from D section which are tied by 4 screws. Component D 1 tied with B section by 1 screw. The screws are needed to keep these parts stable. It
locks B section firmly completing the core mechanism design. It is a reason why wheels are
belongs to the different section, they also present the different function. The architecture of the
car starts from the inside to outside collecting the inner sections first. If section A,B is assemble
incorrectly the car will not move. It is important to remeber that the movement can be performed only along X axis. One way to ensure that the car achives KCs is to follow the logic to
assemble components from inside to outside and to tie them properly, especially A,B sections.-
For example, components D5 play less important role in car operation than components of
A,B,C sections.</p>
<h3>A</h3/>

<ol>
  <li>Core Rod-holds wheel weights (A2) allowing them to spin</li> 
  <li>Wheel Weights- 4 metallic weights sit on the rod (A1)</li>
  <li> Core Gears - 2 parts at the middle of A1to transfer spin </li> 
  <li>Core Spacer- Part which revents Core Spring from friction</li> 
  <li>Core Spring-Part which is located between gears (A3)</li> 
</ol>
  <h3>B</h3/>

<ol>
  
  <li>Wheel Base Shell- B1 -protects and covers Wheel parts</li> 
  <li>Spur Wheel Gears- 2 identical parts (B2) attached to the shafts</li>
  <li>Spur Wheel Gears - 2 identical parts (B3)  </li> 
  <li>Shaft- 2 identical pieces (B4) which support wheels C1</li> 
</ol>
  <h3>C</h3/>

<ol>  

  <li>Car Wheel - 4 main Wheels C1sit on the B4</li> 
  <li>Wheel Parts- 2 parts C2 which part of the C1 correct operation
they sit on B4</li>
 </ol>

  <h3>D</h3/>

<ol> 
  <li> Core inner Shell- D1, 2 pieces tied together by D2 to hold B4 and
to connect A and B sections with D section</li> 
  <li>Screw- D2, 1 piece tie together D1 to keep them stable</li>
  <li>Car Shell - D3 Cover Section B and tied firmly together by D4</li> 
  <li> Screws- D4 tie D3 to ensure the stability</li> 
  <li>Car Inner Shell- 2 identical pieces D5 which inserted into D3</li> 
  <li>Car Inner Shell parts - D6 - inserted into D3 less functional parts</li>

    <p>A flywheel is a mechanical device which uses the conservation of angu
-lar momentum to store rotational energy. Since a flywheel serves to store 
mechanical energy for later use, it is natural to consider it as a kinetic 
energy analogue of an electrical inductor. Once suitably abstracted, 
this shared principle of energy storage is described in the generalized 
concept of an accumulator.  More precisely, a flywheel's stored energy 
will donate a surge in power output upon a drop in power input and will 
conversely absorb any excess power input (system-generated power) in 
the form of rotational energy.Flywheels are often used to provide contin
-uous power output in systems where the energy source is not continuous.
To activate the car we need to push it giving wheels a spin by dragging 
them on a surface. When the car is pushed the inertia of the flywheel 
keeps it rolling smoothly. Flywheel spins around giving the output.</p>
